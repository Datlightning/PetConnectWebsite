[['Employee Spotlight: Ishita Banerjee', "\nSince the founding of PetConnect, Vice President of Marketing Ishita Banerjee displays consistent effort managing her department. Ishita comes into the office prepared with daily assignments for her team – all with a warm smile. \n\nIshita especially resonates with PetConnect because her golden retriever, Koko, partially inspired the company's mission. \n\n“A lot of the time, Koko eats half of her food, leaves, and then two hours later, she'll come back and finish. The issue is, by then, the food is pretty much stale,” Ishita said. PetConnect's “PetFresh” – an automatic, motion-activated smart feeder – resolves this issue by storing the food and retaining its freshness when your pet isn't nearby.\n\nWhen designing the products, she said she thinks about Koko with each detail meticulously added. For example, PetConnect's “PetBrella” is specifically planned to cover pets' eyes, which Ishita identified as an issue she and Koko encounter.\n\nAlso, Ishita heavily contributed to the company's sales pitch for the NYC, NY Metro, and Northeast Online Thanksgiving Trade Show, and she spent hours perfecting PetConnect's product designs and descriptions. \n\n“I'm incredibly impressed with the time Ishita dedicates to PetConnect and her continuous commitment. She's a valuable pillar of our company,” CEO Akshay Dhawan said.\n\nSimultaneously, she keeps the Marketing Department on task and focused, pinpointing her employees' strengths and inspiring them to bring their all to the company. Marketing Associate Riya Jain said, “Ishita is a great supervisor and mentor, as she is extremely dedicated to the company, helping us spread our company's mission of using technology to nurture pets.”\n", 'blogimages/ishita.png', 'Navya Vasireddy', 'employee_spotlight', '', 'H', 2, 2], ['PetConnect Surpasses Expectations at November Trade Show', 'On Monday, Nov. 20, PetConnect participated in the NYC, NY Metro, and Northeast Online Thanksgiving Trade Show, which ran from 7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. \n\nPetConnect employees have been working tirelessly for the past two weeks in preparation for the event — and their hard work paid off. \n\nPetConnect sold over 1000 products, ranging from heated pet beds to motion-activated pet food dispensers. “We had an amazing turnout, and all the credit goes to our amazing staff. It really was a collective effort, and I’m so pleased with everyone’s commitment,” said Akshay Dhawan, CEO of PetConnect.\n\nAkshay also gave a special thanks to the Marketing Department, overseen by Ishita Banerjee, for its consistent effort and time spent on the Trade Show. He appreciated the hours the department spent finalizing product descriptions and designs, along with writing the sales pitch.\n\nFollowing the Trade Show, PetConnect’s staff reflected on the Trade Show and their goals for next time.\n\n“We were able to hold our ground, and I’m really proud of us, especially for this being our first Trade Show,” Ishita said. “Next time, I think we’ll be a lot less nervous and a lot more prepared, which I hope will help us surpass our numbers.” \n\nAkshay said that he aims to connect with more companies, stay more organized in sales, and gain more revenue.\n\n', 'blogimages/trade_show.png', 'Navya Vasireddy', 'trade_show', 'PetConnect employees preparing for the Trade Show', 'V', 2, 2]]
