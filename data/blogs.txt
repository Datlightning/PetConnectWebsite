[['Employee Spotlight: Ishita Banerjee', "\nSince the founding of PetConnect, Vice President of Marketing Ishita Banerjee displays consistent effort managing her department. Ishita comes into the office prepared with daily assignments for her team – all with a warm smile. \n\nIshita especially resonates with PetConnect because her golden retriever, Koko, partially inspired the company's mission. \n\n“A lot of the time, Koko eats half of her food, leaves, and then two hours later, she'll come back and finish. The issue is, by then, the food is pretty much stale,” Ishita said. PetConnect's “PetFresh” – an automatic, motion-activated smart feeder – resolves this issue by storing the food and retaining its freshness when your pet isn't nearby.\n\nWhen designing the products, she said she thinks about Koko with each detail meticulously added. For example, PetConnect's “PetBrella” is specifically planned to cover pets' eyes, which Ishita identified as an issue she and Koko encounter.\n\nAlso, Ishita heavily contributed to the company's sales pitch for the NYC, NY Metro, and Northeast Online Thanksgiving Trade Show, and she spent hours perfecting PetConnect's product designs and descriptions. \n\n“I'm incredibly impressed with the time Ishita dedicates to PetConnect and her continuous commitment. She's a valuable pillar of our company,” CEO Akshay Dhawan said.\n\nSimultaneously, she keeps the Marketing Department on task and focused, pinpointing her employees' strengths and inspiring them to bring their all to the company. Marketing Associate Riya Jain said, “Ishita is a great supervisor and mentor, as she is extremely dedicated to the company, helping us spread our company's mission of using technology to nurture pets.”\n", 'people/ishita.png', 'Navya Vasireddy', '1']]
